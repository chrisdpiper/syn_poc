so we can ask questions on frogs, ai and chemistry

frogs:
tell me about frogs
how many species of frogs are there


science:
what is an atomic weight
what is uranium
what is the atomic weight of uranium
who are famous women scientists
who is madam curie 
How does the concept of electronegativity explain the formation of different types of chemical bonds (ionic, covalent, and metallic)?
Why is accuracy and precision important in chemistry? 
How does the molecular structure of a material impact its properties on a macro scale and the way that material functions? 
What is the temperature at which the vapor pressure of a liquid slightly exceeds the pressure of the atmosphere above the liquid?
What theory states that equal volumes of different gases contain the same number of molecules when compared under the same conditions.
What are atoms of the same element that differ in weight?
The inner-most electron shell can contain how many electrons?
Why does salt dissolve in water, but not in oil?

AI:

what are key benefits of ai 
how ddoes ai bewnefit our lives?

are are key issues with ai
what economnic issues with ai exist
who is katalin
what does katalin believe about ai?

what is a digital agency capsule?
what are the benefits of a digital agency capsule

who will benfit the most from ai?


ramdon general:
sharks
squirrels


less than optimal examples:
who is walcottd

what does katalin believe?
what is a homerun?
what is a cool task?

list cities mentioned
list latitudes mentioned


question:what is the statistcal probability that katalin would agreee with openai's use of data
---
answer:
---
 The given context does not provide enough information to determine the statistical probability that 
 Katalin BÃ¡rtfai-Walcott agrees with OpenAI's use of data. However, it is evident from her comment 
 that she shares concerns about data ownership and suggests embedding sovereignty into data for greater control. 
 This could potentially imply disagreement with OpenAI's approach to using data without return value 
 to the original creators; however, more context or direct quotes regarding OpenAI's specific use of 
 data would be needed to make an accurate assessment.
